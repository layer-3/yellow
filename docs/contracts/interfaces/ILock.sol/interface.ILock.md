**Title:**
ILock

Single-asset vault with a time-locked withdrawal mechanism.
Users lock tokens, initiate an unlock, and withdraw after the waiting period.
State machine per user:
lock(amount)            unlock()             withdraw()
Idle ─────────────► Locked ─────────────► Unlocking ──────────► Idle
│                      │
lock(amount) adds to balance,    relock()
stays Locked              returns to Locked


## Functions
### asset

The address of the single ERC-20 token this vault accepts.


```solidity
function asset() external view returns (address);
```

### lockStateOf

Returns the current lock state for a user.


```solidity
function lockStateOf(address user) external view returns (LockState);
```

### balanceOf

Returns the locked balance for a user.


```solidity
function balanceOf(address user) external view returns (uint256);
```

### unlockTimestampOf

Returns the timestamp when withdraw() becomes callable (0 if not unlocking).


```solidity
function unlockTimestampOf(address user) external view returns (uint256);
```

### lock

Transfers `amount` tokens from the caller into the vault, crediting `target`.
Can be called multiple times to add to an existing Locked balance.
Reverts with AlreadyUnlocking if `target` is in the Unlocking state.


```solidity
function lock(address target, uint256 amount) external;
```

### unlock

Starts the waiting period for the caller's full balance.
Reverts with NotLocked if the caller has no balance.
Reverts with AlreadyUnlocking if unlock() was already called.


```solidity
function unlock() external;
```

### relock

Cancels an in-progress unlock and returns to Locked state.
Restores collateral weight. Reverts with NotUnlocking if not unlocking.


```solidity
function relock() external;
```

### withdraw

Transfers the caller's full balance to `destination`.
Reverts with NotUnlocking if unlock() was not called.
Reverts with UnlockPeriodNotElapsed if the waiting period has not elapsed.


```solidity
function withdraw(address destination) external;
```
