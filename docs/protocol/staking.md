# Collateral

Both NodeRegistry and AppRegistry implement the `ILock` interface — a single-asset vault with a time-locked withdrawal mechanism. Node operators and app builders post YELLOW tokens as a mandatory functional security deposit, initiate an unlock, wait for the period to elapse, then withdraw.

Node operators post collateral to register and operate clearnode infrastructure on the Yellow Network using Layer3 Fintech Ltd.'s open-source software. App builders post collateral on the AppRegistry as a service quality guarantee for applications registered on the network.

## State Machine

```
        lock(target, amount)       unlock()            withdraw(destination)
  Idle ──────────────────► Locked ──────────► Unlocking ─────────────────► Idle
                              │                   │
                        lock() top-up          relock()
                        (stays Locked)     (back to Locked)
```

### States

| State | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Idle | 0 | No locked balance |
| Locked | 1 | Tokens are locked as collateral |
| Unlocking | 2 | Countdown started, waiting for unlock period |

## Functions

### lock(target, amount)

Deposits `amount` YELLOW tokens into the vault, crediting `target`. The caller must have approved the registry to spend their tokens. Can be called multiple times to top up while in the Locked state.

- **Reverts** if `target` is in Unlocking state (`AlreadyUnlocking`)
- **Reverts** if `amount` is zero (`InvalidAmount`)
- Anyone can lock tokens on behalf of another address

### unlock()

Starts the withdrawal countdown for the caller's full balance. The unlock period is set at deployment (default 14 days).

- **Reverts** if caller has no locked balance (`NotLocked`)
- **Reverts** if already unlocking (`AlreadyUnlocking`)
- **NodeRegistry:** immediately removes the operator's collateral weight from parameter administration

### relock()

Cancels an in-progress unlock and returns to the Locked state.

- **Reverts** if not in Unlocking state (`NotUnlocking`)
- **NodeRegistry:** immediately restores the operator's collateral weight

### withdraw(destination)

Transfers the caller's full locked balance to `destination` after the unlock period has elapsed.

- **Reverts** if not in Unlocking state (`NotUnlocking`)
- **Reverts** if countdown hasn't finished (`UnlockPeriodNotElapsed`)
- Resets state to Idle
