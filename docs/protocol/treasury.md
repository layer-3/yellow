# Treasury

The Treasury is a secure vault for Layer3 Foundation assets. It supports ETH and ERC-20 transfers and is protected by `Ownable2Step` to prevent accidental ownership loss.

The Foundation Treasury is funded by fees from Yellow App Store subscriptions and premium application-layer features, and is used to fund continued research, development, and delivery of the goods and services accessible through YELLOW. Protocol fees from clearing and trading operations are separate and are locked into node operators' collateral (see [Collateral](./staking.md)).

## Transfer Function

```solidity
function transfer(
    address token,   // address(0) for ETH, otherwise ERC-20 address
    address to,      // destination address
    uint256 amount   // amount to transfer
) external onlyOwner nonReentrant;
```

- Only the owner can call `transfer()`
- For ERC-20 tokens with fee-on-transfer, the event emits the actual amount received
- `renounceOwnership()` is disabled to prevent permanently locking funds

## Ownership

The Treasury uses OpenZeppelin's `Ownable2Step`:

1. Current owner calls `transferOwnership(newOwner)`
2. New owner calls `acceptOwnership()` to complete the transfer

This two-step process prevents accidentally transferring ownership to an incorrect address.

### Ownership Models

**Foundation-owned (direct):**
- The Foundation multisig is the owner
- Can call `transfer()` directly

**Parameter-administration-owned (via TimelockController):**
- The TimelockController is the owner
- Transfers require a parameter administration proposal: propose, reach operator consensus, queue, execute
- Provides oversight by active node operators over treasury funds

## Receiving Funds

The Treasury accepts:
- **ETH** — via the `receive()` function (just send ETH to the contract)
- **ERC-20** — via standard `transfer()` or `transferFrom()` to the contract address
